# Relational Databases and PostgreSQL

## Introduction
Charles Severance explores the fundamentals of relational databases, focusing on PostgreSQL.

## Basics of Relational Databases
- Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns.
- Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to interact with databases.

## Terminology
- Database: Contains one or more tables.
- Relation (Table): Contains tuples (rows) and attributes (columns).
- Tuple: Represents an object, and attributes are its elements.

## Common Database Systems
- PostgreSQL: 100% open source and feature-rich.
- Oracle: Large, commercial, enterprise-scale.
- MySQL: Fast and scalable, commercial open source.
- SqlServer: Microsoft's database management system.

## SQL Architecture
- Components include Database Server, User, DBA, pgAdmin, and psql.

## Getting Started with PostgreSQL
- Connect using the command line: `$ psql -U postgres`.
- Create a user, database, and connect to it.

## Creating a Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    name VARCHAR(128),
    email VARCHAR(128)
);
```

## SQL Operations
- Insert, delete, update, and select data.
- Examples of SQL commands:
  - `INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Chuck', 'csev@umich.edu');`
  - `DELETE FROM users WHERE email='ted@umich.edu';`
  - `UPDATE users SET name='Charles' WHERE email='csev@umich.edu';`
  - `SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY email;`

## Data Types in PostgreSQL
- Text, binary, numeric, integer, floating-point, and date types.

## Database Keys and Indexes
- AUTO_INCREMENT for primary keys.
- PostgreSQL functions like NOW().
- Use of indexes, such as B-trees and hashes.

## Summary
- SQL allows describing data and performing CRUD operations.
- Operations include Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
